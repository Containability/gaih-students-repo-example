#Explain your work
#I am taking random variables from random library. And then i will check them if they are prime. 
#If they are prime i will append them to my 3x3 2-D array.If not they will pop

#Question 1
import random
import time
random.seed()

#This while keeps going until it finds 9 random prime numbers.

while i<9:
    flag=False #This flag is false every iteration
    randoms.append(random.randint(0,1000))
    for a in range(2,randoms[i]):
        if((randoms[i]%a)==0):

            flag=True #Becomes true if this number can be divided to some number below it
            
            
        
        
    i=i+1
    if(flag):
        i=i-1
        print(count,randoms[i],a,"Not Found") #For checking the iteration.
